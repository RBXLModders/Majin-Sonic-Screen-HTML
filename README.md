# Majin-Sonic-Screen-HTML
A recreation of the secret Majin Sonic screen seen in the sound test menu in Sonic CD in HTML!

This recreation has
1. Correct Positioning
2. Accurate images
3. Original BGM (that autoplays!)

bgm.js is for the autoplaying background music. (Using the same method modern day screamers use to bypass autoplay permission stuff)
